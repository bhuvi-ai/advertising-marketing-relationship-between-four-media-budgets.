Infer relationship between four media budgets.

The company provided sales data from 200 different markets.

The data also contains the advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, radio, and newspaper.

The client cannot directly increase the sales of the product.

But they can adjust the advertisement budget for each of the three media. As a data scientist, if you can establish the relationship between advertisement expenditure and sales, you can provide your feedback on how to adjust the budgets so that sales can increase.

So, the objective is to develop a model that you can use to predict the sales on the basis of the three media budgets.
